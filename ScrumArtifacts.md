# Scrum Artifacts

The Scrum Guide provides the following guidance related to [Scrum Artifacts](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts):

## Product Backlog

>The [Product Backlog](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts-productbacklog) is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The **Product Owner** is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering.
>
>A Product Backlog is never complete. The earliest development of it lays out the initially known and best-understood requirements. The Product Backlog evolves as the product and the environment in which it will be used evolves. The Product Backlog is dynamic; it constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful. If a product exists, its Product Backlog also exists.
>
>The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to be made to the product in future releases. Product Backlog items have the attributes of a description, order, estimate, and value. Product Backlog items often include test descriptions that will prove its completeness when "Done".
>
>As a product is used and gains value, and the marketplace provides feedback, the Product Backlog becomes a larger and more exhaustive list. Requirements never stop changing, so a Product Backlog is a living artifact. Changes in business requirements, market conditions, or technology may cause changes in the Product Backlog.
>
>Multiple Scrum Teams often work together on the same product. One Product Backlog is used to describe the upcoming work on the product. A Product Backlog attribute that groups items may then be employed.
>
>Product Backlog refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. This is an ongoing process in which the **Product Owner** and the **Development Team** collaborate on the details of Product Backlog items. During Product Backlog refinement, items are reviewed and revised. The Scrum Team decides how and when refinement is done. Refinement usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team. However, Product Backlog items can be updated at any time by the **Product Owner** or at the **Product Owner**’s discretion.
>
>Higher ordered Product Backlog items are usually clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones. More precise estimates are made based on the greater clarity and increased detail; the lower the order, the less detail. Product Backlog items that will occupy the **Development Team** for the upcoming Sprint are refined so that any one item can reasonably be "Done" within the Sprint time-box. Product Backlog items that can be "Done" by the **Development Team** within one Sprint are deemed "Ready" for selection in a Sprint Planning. Product Backlog items usually acquire this degree of transparency through the above described refining activities.
>
>The **Development Team** is responsible for all estimates. The **Product Owner** may influence the **Development Team** by helping it understand and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform the work make the final estimate.
>
>### Monitoring Progress Toward Goals
>
>At any point in time, the total work remaining to reach a goal can be summed. The **Product Owner** tracks this total work remaining at least every Sprint Review. The **Product Owner** compares this amount with work remaining at previous Sprint Reviews to assess progress toward completing projected work by the desired time for the goal. This information is made transparent to all stakeholders.
>
>Various projective practices upon trending have been used to forecast progress, like burn-downs, burn-ups, or cumulative flows. These have proven useful. However, these do not replace the importance of empiricism. In complex environments, what will happen is unknown. Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision-making.
>
## Sprint Backlog

>The [Sprint Backlog](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts-sprintbacklog) is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the **Development Team** about what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality into a "Done" Increment.
>
>The Sprint Backlog makes visible all the work that the **Development Team** identifies as necessary to meet the Sprint Goal. To ensure continuous improvement, it includes at least one high priority process improvement identified in the previous Retrospective meeting.
>
>The Sprint Backlog is a plan with enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in the Daily Scrum. The **Development Team** modifies the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint. This emergence occurs as the **Development Team** works through the plan and learns more about the work needed to achieve the Sprint Goal.
>
>As new work is required, the **Development Team** adds it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is performed or completed, the estimated remaining work is updated. When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only the **Development Team** can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint. The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the **Development Team** plans to accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the Development Team.
>
>**Monitoring Sprint Progress**
>
>At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog can be summed. The **Development Team** tracks this total work remaining at least for every Daily Scrum to project the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal. By tracking the remaining work throughout the Sprint, the **Development Team** can manage its progress.

## Increment
>The [Increment](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts-increment) is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be "Done," which means it must be in useable condition and meet the Scrum Team’s definition of "Done". An increment is a body of inspectable, done work that supports empiricism at the end of the Sprint. The increment is a step toward a vision or goal. The increment must be in useable condition regardless of whether the **Product Owner** decides to release it.
